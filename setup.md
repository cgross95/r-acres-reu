## Get started with RStudio on the HPCC

To use RStudio on the HPCC, we will use OnDemand. Log in here: [https://ondemand.hpcc.msu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/](https://ondemand.hpcc.msu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/).

After logging in, from the Interactive Apps pull-down tab, choose RStudio Server.

In the settings for the interactive job, set "Number of hours" to 3 and "Number of cores per task" to 4. Leave the remaining entries blank and click the Launch button.

You will be taken to a list of your interactive jobs. After queuing, your job will start running, and you can access RStudio by clicking the "Connect to RStudio Server" button.
